  reasoning_summary: "**Examining user requirements**\n\nI need to really grasp the user's request. It sounds like they're\
    \ a Game Master looking for a detailed, step-by-step process to identify who acts next. They mention producing a JSON\
    \ with a \"next_actor\" field, which includes an ID and reasoning. However, they also referenced a \"spotlight_probability_comparisons\"\
    \ array, which is missing in the final output. The expectation seems to be for that array to be included because it appears\
    \ crucial for comprehensive probability relationships. This inconsistency needs attention.\n**Deciding on JSON output**\n\
    \nI need to determine how to construct the output. The instructions clearly state to provide valid JSON in a specific\
    \ format, strictly for the \"next_actor\" object. However, there's a conflicting note about including a \"spotlight_probability_comparisons\"\
    \ array, which isn't part of the required format. This poses a challenge. Since they emphasized adhering to “exact format”\
    \ strictly, I'm concerned about adding any extra keys. The probability comparisons might be contextually important, but\
    \ I must prioritize the specified format. This decision is crucial.\n\n---\n\n**Exploring tavern scenarios**\n\nI'm considering\
    \ crafting an environment, like \"an average tavern common room\" or an \"abandoned stone chamber.\" I want to identify\
    \ potential consequences for the player's actions. One key consequence is the player succeeding in spotting ordinary details,\
    \ with a high probability of around 0.95. \n\nThen there's noticing small hazards, such as a loose floorboard, with a\
    \ probability of perhaps 0.2. Spotting a hidden observer could happen too, at a lower chance of 0.05. It seems important\
    \ to include both the possibility of noticing and missing details, while aiming to create 6-12 distinct consequences overall.\n\
    **Listing outcomes and actions**\n\nI’m organizing a list of possible outcomes for the player's exploration. For example,\
    \ \"ClearAssessment\" allows for an accurate mapping of the room layout, with a high probability. On the other hand, \"\
    OverlookThreat\" is about missing hidden traps, which might occur simultaneously but doesn't have to. \n\nI want to note\
    \ probabilities for actions like \"NoticeHiddenCompartment\" or \"EyeStrain,\" along with proactive actions by NPCs, such\
    \ as a cat grooming itself or a patron sipping from a mug. It seems I should also consider NPC reactions and create a\
    \ few joint probabilities for different outcomes, ensuring they fit the time allocated for scanning."
