  dm: 'You advance along the Old Road, each step measured, your eyes scanning the
    dappled shadows. The air, thick with the scent of moss and damp earth, carries
    the distant whisper of wind through leaves – a familiar quiet that always feels
    poised on the edge of something else. Then, the forest itself seems to hold its
    breath, a perfect, predatory stillness, before it erupts. A guttural howl tears
    through the quiet, followed by the sharp snap of branches. From the dense undergrowth
    on either side, figures burst forth – wolfmen, their forms a terrifying blend
    of lupine and humanoid, closing the distance with unnatural speed.


    The sudden violence catches you off guard, a jolt of surprise running through
    you as the first wolfman lunges. Even your caution, your constant scanning, wasn''t
    enough to anticipate the sheer ferocity of the ambush. Eiliad, ever ready, draws
    her shortbow, her movements fluid and practiced. But the attackers are already
    too close for a clean shot, the advantage lost before the first arrow can fly.
    Firghorm lets out a roar, his shield snapping up as he moves to intercept the
    closest threats, a bulwark against the tide. His stance is solid, unwavering,
    a familiar sight of dependable defense. Draenen''s satchel hits the cobblestones
    with a thud; she scrambles desperately for her knife, her face a mask of panic,
    her usual composure shattered by the raw, immediate danger. Luath stumbles back,
    his hands fumbling with a vial of moonshade, his eyes wide with sheer terror.
    His immediate instinct is flight and self-medication, his mind already seeking
    escape from the present horror.'
