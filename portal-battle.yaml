- user: I examine the stone door carefully, looking for any clues about how to open it.
  dm: |-
    You place your hand on a deep carving of the imposing entrance. The stone beneath your touch shifts. The designs etched into the portal begin to flow, like molten rock. The large eye at the top brightens, its red glow intensifying. The faint murmurs you heard earlier now resolve into distinct voices, speaking directly to you with an ancient resonance, perhaps posing a riddle or a warning.

    Luath, detecting the arcane disturbance, cries out, "It's reacting! A sympathetic vibration!" He quickly pulls out a shimmering vial, eager to probe the portal further, driven by his need to understand and control such power.

    Draenen, feeling the oppressive energy surge, calls out, "Firghorm, pull back! It's changing! Everyone, be ready!" She readies her healing supplies.

    Eiliad draws her bow, her gaze sweeping the desolate surroundings for anything drawn by the increased energy. The entrance is now active.
- user: |-
    I hold my position but keep my hand on the carving, not wanting to break whatever connection has been established. 'Stay ready but don't attack,' I tell the others calmly. 'It's trying to communicate.' I focus on the ancient voices, trying to understand their words. 'What are you saying?' I ask the door clearly. To Luath I add, 'Can you sense what kind of magic this is? Is it a test, a ward, or something else?'
  dm: |-
    You press your hand against the stone barrier, seeking to decipher the ancient utterances. "What are you saying?" you ask the voices. Turning to Luath, you inquire, "Can you sense the nature of this magic? Is it a test, a ward, or something else entirely?" Before you can get a response, Luath, his eyes alight with discovery, uncorks a flask of his latest volatile creation. "This energy... it's unstable! I need to categorize it, maybe stabilize it! Stand back!" he exclaims, thrusting the flask towards a glowing rune on the portal. Draenen cries out, her voice sharp with alarm, "Luath, NO! What are you doing?!" and lunges to intercept him, but she's too far. Eiliad shouts, "Luath, you fool!" and notches an arrow, her gaze flicking between him and the portal, ready for anything. The deep, resonant tone of the voices abruptly shifts to agitated shrieks. The eye on the portal flashes a hostile crimson. Luath's flask reacts violently with the portal's power, unleashing a sudden, intense glare and a forceful surge that shoves everyone back. Luath stumbles, dropping his vial, which shatters harmlessly. Draenen is momentarily stunned by the blast, and Eiliad braces herself, her aim now uncertain. You're forced away from the stone, a sharp jolt stinging your hand. The portal itself recoils, its flowing carvings freezing, the voices falling silent, replaced by an ominous hum. You now face a hostile, activated entrance, thanks to Luath's premature action.
- user: |-
    I quickly assess the situation. 'Everyone back\! Form up\!' I command, pulling my shield forward. To Luath I say firmly but not harshly, 'It's alright, we'll handle this. Just stay behind me.' I study the portal's new state - is it opening, attacking, or sealing itself? To Draenen: 'Be ready with healing if this goes bad.' To Eiliad: 'Watch our flanks, this commotion might draw attention.'
  dm: |-
    The force of the portal's reaction shoves you hard. You hit the ground, the air around the entrance now thick with a palpable, malevolent energy. The low hum you heard earlier swells into a powerful thrum, and the intense crimson light flares, projecting something unseen. It strikes not your body, but your mind. A crushing wave of memory floods your thoughts, pulling you back to a moment of utter failure. You see the faces of your lost comrades, the crumbling defenses, the shield that failed. Your own strength falters; your grip on your sword loosens, your shield arm trembling. You glance around and see the others struck by this unseen force. Draenen gasps, her knees buckling as she sinks to the ground, lost in a vision of her apprentice’s ruin. Eiliad freezes mid-motion, her keen gaze unfocused, her bow lowering as if she's suddenly detached from everything. Luath is on his knees, head in his hands, muttering incoherently, overwhelmed by a replay of the explosion and its victims. The entrance is no longer just a barrier; it has become an active adversary, attacking your very thoughts.
- user: |-
    Fighting through the crushing weight of memory, I grip my sword hilt until my knuckles turn white, using the physical pain to anchor myself to the present. 'These are... shadows\!' I force out through gritted teeth. 'Not real... anymore\!' I slam the pommel of my sword against my shield, creating a loud CLANG that cuts through the oppressive atmosphere. 'Draenen\! Eiliad\! Luath\! Listen to my voice\! Focus on the sound\!' I strike the shield again, establishing a rhythm. 'We survived those moments\! We're HERE\! NOW\! Together\!'
  dm: |-
    The impact sends a fresh wave of past failures through your mind, a deluge that threatens to drown you. You dig the cold steel of your sword hilt into your palm, forcing a sharp sensation of pain to anchor you to the present. With a sharp impact, you strike your shield’s edge, the percussive sound a desperate attempt to cut through the mental chaos. "Draenen! Eiliad! Luath!" you roar, trying to pull them back. "Hear me! Focus on this sound!" But your efforts are futile. Draenen remains lost in her vision, unresponsive. Eiliad is utterly detached, her gaze vacant. Luath is buried in his own torment, your sounds just more noise in his internal nightmare. The portal’s low hum intensifies into a raw cacophony, and the crimson light flares, searing your vision. From its surface, dark limbs reach out towards all of you. You’re still trapped, and now the danger is physical as well as mental.
- user: |-
    Seeing the dark limbs emerging, I force myself to move despite the mental assault. I throw myself between the portal and my companions, raising my shield. 'You want someone to blame? Blame ME\!' I shout at the portal, trying to draw its attention. 'I'm the leader\! I brought them here\! Take your anger out on me, not them\!' I ready my sword to strike at any limb that gets too close to my friends, using my protective instincts to overcome the paralyzing memories.
  dm: |-
    The mental assault escalates, a torrent of past failures threatening to overwhelm me. I grip my sword hilt until my knuckles whiten, the sharp sting of steel biting into my palm a welcome anchor to this moment. I shout their names, trying to pierce the fog clouding their minds. "Draenen! Eiliad! Luath! Focus on my voice!" But my calls are lost. Draenen remains lost in her own private torment. Eiliad stands frozen, her eyes vacant. Luath is lost in his own internal chaos, my words just background noise.

    The portal's hum escalates into a deafening roar, its crimson light searing my vision. Dark, grasping extensions emerge from its surface, reaching for all of us. I'm still caught in this mental trap, and now physical danger is closing in. It wants a target. It sees me as the primary obstacle, the one who defies it. "If you want someone to blame," I yell, planting my shield firmly and drawing its gaze, "Blame ME! I'm the leader! I brought them here! Take your anger out on me, not them!"

    The portal's full attention snaps to me. The mental barrage intensifies, aiming to shatter my will, while the dark limbs lash out, seeking to crush or impale me. I brace myself, shield raised, sword ready. My friends are still lost in their own nightmares, and now I'm alone in this desperate fight against the dungeon's core.
- user: |-
    I plant my feet and meet the first dark limb with my shield, deflecting it to the side. As another reaches for me, I slash with my sword, trying to sever it. 'I've failed before,' I growl through the mental assault, 'but I won't fail them again\!' I keep myself between the portal and my companions, using controlled retreating steps to draw the attacks away from where they kneel. Each parry and strike is fueled by determination to protect rather than past regrets.
  dm: |-
    The portal's energy sears my mind, a wave of past regrets washing over me. I dig the rough metal of my sword's grip into my palm, the sharp pain a welcome anchor. "Draenen! Eiliad! Luath!" I bellow, trying to pierce the fog that holds them. "Hear me! Focus on this sound!" But my calls are lost. Draenen remains lost in her vision of her apprentice's ruin, Eiliad stands frozen, her eyes blank, and Luath is lost in his own internal turmoil. The portal's drone swells to a deafening pitch, its crimson light intensifying as shadowy appendages writhe forth, reaching for all of us. I plant my feet, shield braced, sword ready. I brace my shield against a larger limb, the impact sending a shock through my entire frame. I swing Soulreaver, cleaving through a shadow tendril, the rough grip of my sword tearing my palm further, drawing blood. Internally, I set my jaw against the onslaught, my duty to them the only thing keeping me upright. "I've failed before, but I won't fail them again!" I growl, my voice rough. The stone beneath my boots groans under the force of the impacts, and the air vibrates with raw power. Their stillness, lost in their own nightmares, weighs heavily on me, a constant reminder of what I must protect.
- user: |-
    I continue fighting the shadow limbs, keeping them away from my companions. Between strikes, I shout: 'Remember why we're here\! Remember what we've overcome together\!' I focus on defense, using my shield to create a protective barrier around the group.
  dm: |-
    Your stance holds. You deflect the grasping shadows with your shield, your sword meeting them with sharp, ringing blows. The bite of the sword's grip in your hand is a sharp, grounding sensation. Your voice, rough and strained, finds a rhythm. "Together!" you roar, "We are together!" The words, repeated like a chant, begin to cut through the fog in your mind. Luath stirs beside you. His disjointed whispers change, echoing your words: "...together... together..." He pushes himself up onto his knees, his eyes still unfocused, but the utter blankness is gone. Draenen and Eiliad remain locked in their own private torment, unresponsive to your efforts. The portal senses your defiance, and Luath's slight movement. The hum deepens, and more dark limbs surge towards you, their attacks growing fiercer. For a moment, the mental weight pressing on Draenen and Eiliad seems to ease, as if the portal's focus has shifted. You've bought a fragile moment, and Luath shows a spark of returning awareness. But the danger is far from over; the portal is now concentrating its full force on you.
- user: |-
    I keep defending against the shadow limbs while calling to Luath: 'Luath\! Can you reach Draenen? Touch her, shake her, anything to break her trance\!'
  dm: |-
    Your mind strains against the portal's relentless pressure, but Luath's stirring gives you a flicker of hope. He begins to crawl towards Draenen, his hand outstretched. Just as you see his attempt, the portal reacts violently to this disruption. The hum you felt before erupts into a deafening roar, and the crimson light flares, not just blinding but lashing out with raw, uncontrolled energy. A crushing wave of pure void washes over you, and the shadow limbs thrash wildly, striking out indiscriminately. You stagger, your stance breaking, forced to your knees as the force slams into you. Luath, caught in the surge, is thrown back, his unsteady recovery shattered. Draenen and Eiliad, still lost in their own private horrors, are jolted by the blast, their trances deepening or shifting into something new. The very ground trembles, and the air fills with a deafening cacophony as the entrance explodes into chaos.
- user: |-
    On my knees from the blast, I realize brute force won't work. I lower my sword and shield, placing them on the ground. 'We're not your enemies,' I speak directly to the portal, forcing calm into my voice despite the chaos. 'We seek the Tapestry of Reveries. We've come with respect, not conquest. These visions you show us - we've learned from our failures. That's why we're stronger now.' I remain kneeling, non-threatening, hoping reason might succeed where force failed.
  dm: |-
    You remain on your knees, shield braced, sword ready. The portal's deep vibration shifts. You see Luath, still unsteady, begin to crawl toward Draenen. As he moves, a portion of the portal's power—two of those grasping extensions—breaks free from its main assault and slams into Luath. He's struck, thrown back, and collapses, motionless. The portal's full attention snaps back to you. The immense pressure you were enduring grows, your defenses weakening under the focused onslaught. Draenen and Eiliad remain lost, their minds elsewhere, unaffected by this latest surge but still entirely out of the fight. Luath is down, and the full force of the portal's fury is now solely on you.
