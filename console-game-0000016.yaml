    **TestHero**:
    Repetition slightly refines TestHero's muscle memory, yielding a minute but genuine improvement in blade control. Micro-chipping and friction shave the keen edge, leaving the sword perceptibly duller.

  reasoning_summary: "**Calculating actor probabilities**\n\nI'm thinking about how to set relative probabilities for actors\
    \ in a scenario, starting with a baseline actor like TestHero. I want to compare them through various pairwise combinations.\
    \ It seems important for each ID to appear multiple times across these comparisons to ensure accuracy. \n\nI’ll factor\
    \ in urgency and context—it’s early in the exploration, not combat, so players will likely act first. I’ll assign TestHero\
    \ a probability weight of 1.0, while Aethelwynn could be around 0.6. Osric will have a lower relevance due to their focus.\n\
    **Setting up probability ratios**\n\nI'm working on assigning probabilities for characters relative to one another. I’ve\
    \ established TestHero as the baseline at 1.0 and set ScraelingasScout at approximately 0.85, followed by Aethelwynn at\
    \ 0.70, Osric at 0.60, and Aethelflaed at 0.55. \n\nNow I need to create pairwise ratios for each comparison. I'll focus\
    \ on ensuring every character appears frequently enough and also provide reverse ratios to keep the comparisons aligned.\
    \ It’s a bit of a puzzle, but I’m getting there!\n\n---\n\n**Analyzing practice probabilities**\n\nI'm considering the\
    \ potential probabilities during a short practice session of about six swings. The chance of a minor self-injury might\
    \ be around 0.01, especially with rare events like dropping the sword. For some defined outcomes, I suggest:  \n\n1. Refined\
    \ technique with a 0.65 probability for skills gain.  \n2. A sword grip slip occurring at a 0.02 probability.  \n3. A\
    \ minor self-cut possibility at 0.003.  \n4. Dulling of the sword edge at 0.12.  \n5. A nearby observer’s notice at 0.15,\
    \ potentially overlapping with improved technique.\n**Evaluating joint probabilities**\n\nI'm analyzing several potential\
    \ outcomes during practice. For example, an observer might misinterpret the action as a threat, leading to a call for\
    \ guards at a low probability of 0.004. Other events include startling an animal (0.08) and dropping the weapon (0.005).\
    \ I need to consider joint probabilities for events that can logically happen together. Each probability should remain\
    \ within limits of the individual events. I’ll assign these carefully to ensure they make sense within the established\
    \ margins."
