    **Considering exploration dynamics**

    There's an ambush of wolfmen about a mile from the crossroads, so no immediate combat is happening — it's more of an exploration moment right now. Any player character could act next, and since it's not urgent, we might rotate among them to give everyone a chance to shine. Eiliad the scout may take the lead or maybe Draenen will pick herbs. I need to think about the probabilities and compute initiative to keep things moving smoothly!
    **Computing next action probability**

    I'm evaluating the probabilities for the next actions of the characters. Eiliad, as the scout, has the highest chance to act because she's exploring the area. Draenen and Luath have moderate chances, with Draenen looking for herbs and Luath observing the environment. Firghorm has a lower probability since he just acted. The wolfmen are too far away to act immediately, but I’ll still include them for completeness. I think the most likely next actor will be Eiliad due to her role and urgency to scout ahead.
