    I approach Elder Thane Eldric and bow respectfully. 'Elder, I have answered your summons. Tell me of these troubling events - the red glows and young Teylan's disappearance. When did this begin?'
  dm: |-
    As Dreamwalker begins to approach Elder Thane Eldric with a respectful bow, Eiliad, ever impatient with perceived inefficiencies, interjects with characteristic pragmatism. "Thane," she calls out, her voice sharp and direct, cutting across Dreamwalker's polite opening, "skip the preamble. What's the immediate danger here? And more importantly, where's the quickest exit if this situation goes south?" Eldric, momentarily taken aback by the abruptness but recognizing the practical concern, pauses his response to Dreamwalker. He gives a curt, though still measured, answer about the rising threat level and points towards a shimmering, unstable portal that flickers into existence momentarily in the distance, stating, "That portal offers a chance for egress, but it is unpredictable." His focus is now divided, and he provides less detail about Teylan's disappearance, prioritizing the immediate safety assessment. Firghorm tenses at Eiliad's interruption, his hand instinctively moving towards his sword hilt, ready for any sudden escalation, but he also notes the information about the escape route. Draenen frowns at Eiliad's lack of decorum, seeing it as disrespectful to Eldric, but her herbalist's mind also registers the mention of an escape route as potentially useful. Luath, momentarily distracted by the talk of escape, begins to consider the alchemical implications of such a portal. The immediate consequence is that the party gains a potential escape route, but their understanding of the core problem—Teylan and the red glows—is significantly diminished, and Eldric may be slightly more guarded due to Eiliad's bluntness.
