    I tell the party we should move north cautiously along the Old Road toward the crossroads.
  dm: |-
    You speak, your voice carrying through the dappled light filtering from the canopy of ancient oaks overhead. "We should move north, cautiously, along the Old Road."

    Firghorm nods, his gray eyes sweeping the dense, shadowed woods. "Vigilance is paramount on such paths," his voice is low. He steps forward, his plain steel shield held ready, his gaze fixed on the moss-slicked cobblestones ahead.

    Eiliad, just beyond your direct line of sight, shifts. Her short black hair is a fleeting glimpse as she moves. "Cautious is good," she calls back, her voice carrying from the treeline. "Just don't expect me to wait around if I spot something." She melts into the deeper shadows to your left, a quick movement swallowed by the forest's deep gloom.

    Draenen stops, her worn leather apron rustling. Her calloused hands go to her satchel, adjusting a strap. "Sensible," she says, her voice rough. "But one must also ensure their footing is secure and their supplies are in order." She fusses with a buckle.

    Luath pauses, his spectacles smudged. He scans the ground, his fingers twitching. A low murmur escapes his lips, speaking of "peculiar soil composition" and "strange growths."

    The group begins to move. Firghorm leads, his shield a solid barrier. Eiliad is a silent scout, a flicker of motion in the undergrowth. Draenen follows, her satchel slung over her shoulder. Luath trails, his attention drawn to the ground beneath his feet. The path ahead remains clear, the rustle of leaves and the distant call of birds the only sounds accompanying your measured advance.
- user: I keep pace with Firghorm and ask him about the Crossroads ahead.

    You fall into step beside Firghorm. His steel shield is already angled forward, his gray eyes fixed on the path ahead. The worn cobblestones of the Old Road stretch before you, dappled sunlight filtering through the ancient oak canopy. Firghormâ€™s voice, low and steady, begins, "Welcome. This path is ancient and treacherous. Keep your wits about you, and stay close. We are bound for the Crossroads."

    Then, a sharp *crack* splits the air from the dense woods to your left, unnervingly close. The dappled sunlight overhead seems to contract, and a wave of cold washes over your skin. A low, guttural growl, impossibly layered, rumbles from multiple directions.

    Firghorm bellows, "Ambush!" His shield snaps higher, his steel longsword flashing into view. Eiliad, a blur of motion, drops into a crouch, an arrow already nocked to her yew shortbow. "Wolfmen!" she hisses. Draenen gasps, her hands tightening on her satchel. She moves behind Firghorm. "What was that?" she asks, her voice trembling. Luath stumbles backward, the samples he carried scattering across the cobblestones. His hands fly to his face as he fumbles for a vial in his pouch.
