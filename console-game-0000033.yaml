- user: I cautiously advance north along the road, keeping my hand on my sword hilt
    and scanning the forest for any signs of danger.
  dm: '**dan**: Cautiously advance north along the road, keeping hand on sword hilt,
    scanning forest. Given the dense forest and dappled light, dan would normally
    scan the immediate surroundings and detect no immediate threats at this distance.
    However, with dan''s slightly negative skills luck, dan might miss a very subtle
    sign, but there is nothing to detect at this range from the ambush. Thus, dan
    advances cautiously, scanning the forest. The dappled light and shifting shadows
    of the Welwaen Forest offer no immediate signs of danger at this distance.


    **Firghorm**: Move with the group, maintaining defensive posture and scanning
    the surroundings. Given Firghorm''s veteran vigilance, he would normally move
    with the group and sweep the forest with his gaze, detecting nothing out of the
    ordinary. However, with Firghorm''s moderately positive initiative luck, he acts
    promptly after dan''s initial movement, and his slightly negative defensive luck
    means he''s fractionally less prepared for an immediate, unexpected threat should
    one appear. He detects no danger.


    **Draenen**: Follow dan, scanning the immediate surroundings for useful plants
    and signs of danger. Given Draenen''s focus on flora, she would normally move
    with the group and scan the undergrowth for herbs, detecting nothing out of the
    ordinary regarding the wolfmen threat. However, with Draenen''s slightly positive
    initiative luck, she acts promptly, and her slightly negative skills luck means
    she overlooks a particularly rare herb that would have been just within her grasp.
    She notices nothing immediately alarming regarding the wolfmen.


    **Luath**: Follow dan, remaining vigilant and perhaps showing nervousness. Given
    Luath''s anxious nature, he would normally follow the group, perhaps fidgeting,
    and remain passive unless his anxiety peaked. However, with Luath''s slightly
    positive initiative luck, he keeps pace with the group without lagging. His neutral
    skills luck means his actions are as expected. He feels the tension of the forest
    and the known threat, but does not yet feel compelled to use his moonshade.


    **Eiliad**: Conduct parallel scouting, moving slightly ahead or to the sides of
    dan, observing for advantages and threats. Given Eiliad''s scouting skills, she
    would normally move stealthily to the side, using her keen senses to observe the
    immediate terrain. At this distance, she would also see nothing related to the
    wolfmen. However, with Eiliad''s moderately negative skills luck, a task she''d
    normally succeed at moderately will narrowly fail, causing her to miss a subtle
    detail. Thus, Eiliad, using her scouting skills, moves slightly ahead and to the
    side of dan''s path. Her keen eyes scan the forest, but the moderately negative
    skills luck causes her to miss a faint deer trail that would have been obvious
    to her. She detects no immediate threats, as the wolfmen are too far away.'

        concerns_or_fears:
        - of failing again
        attitude_towards_action: He views dan's cautious advance and vigilance (hand
          on sword hilt, scanning the forest) as sensible and appropriate given the
          known threat of wolfmen. He feels reassured by dan's prudence and readiness
          to defend.
        self_initiated_action: Passive. He will observe dan's actions and maintain
          defensive readiness, his presence a silent anchor for the group.
      - npc_name: Draenen
        emotional_state: Draenen is a stern, burdened herbalist who feels the weight
          of responsibility for the group's well-being
        immediate_objectives:
        - s to be appreciated and in control of the group's safety, and is trying
          to achieve this by monitoring their progress and potential threats, ready
          to provide remedies and subtly assert her importance
        concerns_or_fears:
        - Unknown threats
        attitude_towards_action: She sees dan's cautious advance as a necessary, albeit
          potentially insufficient, measure. She approves of the vigilance but might
          internally critique if she feels it's not thorough enough or misses specific
          environmental cues she would notice. She will be assessing the situation
          for her own purposes, looking for useful plants or signs of danger.
        self_initiated_action: Passive. She will observe the environment for resources
          or threats and assess the group's needs, ready to act if a specific opportunity
          or danger arises.
      - npc_name: Eiliad
        emotional_state: Eiliad is a cunning, pragmatic scout
        immediate_objectives:
        - ing to be safe and secure while avoiding emotional pain
        concerns_or_fears:
        - Unknown threats
        attitude_towards_action: She sees dan's cautious advance as predictable and
          safe, but perhaps too slow. She approves of the vigilance but will be conducting
          her own, more active, scouting in parallel, looking for advantages dan might
          miss. She might mentally note dan's approach as 'safe but slow'.
        self_initiated_action: Passive. She will conduct her own parallel scouting
          and observation, assessing threats and escape routes, perhaps moving slightly
          ahead or to the sides of dan.
      - npc_name: Luath
        emotional_state: Luath is a nervous, guilt-ridden alchemist
        immediate_objectives:
        - s to escape his guilt and find redemption, feeling competent and useful,
          while also trying to manage his addiction
        concerns_or_fears:
        - Unknown threats
        attitude_towards_action: He sees dan's caution as sensible. The vigilance
          might increase his own anxiety, making him more aware of his own vulnerabilities
          and perhaps more inclined to consider using moonshade for focus. He will
          likely remain passive but internally processing the risk and his own capabilities.
        self_initiated_action: Passive. He will remain with the group, perhaps fidgeting
          or glancing at his supplies, and might consider discreetly taking moonshade
          if his anxiety increases.
      - npc_name: Wolfmen Pack (Ambush)
        emotional_state: The Wolfmen pack is predatory, territorial, and focused on
          their ambush
        immediate_objectives:
        - Maintain current position
        concerns_or_fears:
        - Unknown threats
        attitude_towards_action: They view dan's cautious advance as typical prey
          behavior. The vigilance is noted as a sign of awareness but not seen as
          a significant threat to their ambush. They will continue to lie in wait,
          assuming their position is secure for now, and will only react when the
          party enters their kill zone.
        self_initiated_action: Passive (in terms of initiating new actions beyond
          the ambush). They are already in a state of readiness, waiting for the optimal
          moment to strike.

      - 'Social luck:

        This round dan has slightly positive social luck; if you''d expect dan to
        narrowly fail in convincing or persuading an NPC, in this situation, dan would
        narrowly succeed.


        Likewise, if they would respond neutrally without the luck, they respond slightly
        positively with social luck slightly on dan''s side.


        Social interactions will be slightly more positive towards dan than they would
        normally be.


        dan''s slightly improved social luck is just enough to overcome social challenges
        dan would find "moderately challenging", but if the social situation is "quite"
        or "very" challenging for dan, dan will fail.

      - 'Attacking luck:

        This round dan has neutral attacking luck; combat outcomes will play out exactly
        as you would normally expect given dan''s abilities and the situation.


        dan''s attacks will land or miss based purely on skill, positioning, and the
        opponent''s defenses.


        Combat exchanges will be neither helped nor hindered by luck.

        those challenges match dan''s combat capabilities.

      - 'Defensive luck:

        This round dan has slightly negative defensive luck; if you''d expect dan
        to be able to dodge, parry, or block an incoming attack, in this situation,
        dan would be unable to execute these defenses.


        Likewise, attacks that would glance off instead find weak spots or vulnerable
        angles with defensive luck slightly against dan.


        dan''s defensive actions and positioning will be slightly less effective than
        they would normally be.


        dan''s slightly reduced defensive luck is just enough to fail against attacks
        dan would find mildly challenging, but if the incoming attack is easy or of
        normal difficulty for dan, dan''s defense will still succeed, perhaps more
        narrowly.

        fail.


        Likewise, if a climbing hold would barely support dan''s weight, it gives
        way, or if dan would just manage to move silently, they make a small noise
        with skills luck slightly against dan.


        dan''s skilled actions will be slightly less effective than they would normally

        This round dan has slightly positive initiative luck; if you''d expect dan
        to act just after another character, in this situation, dan would act just
        before them.


        Likewise, if dan would barely miss noticing an opening to act, they would
        spot it just in time with initiative luck slightly on dan''s side.


        dan''s reactions and timing will be slightly faster than they would normally
        be.


        dan''s slightly improved initiative luck is just enough to act before opponents
        dan would find "moderately quick", but if the opponent is "quite" or "very"
        fast, they will still act first.

  rotations: []
- user: We continue another mile north. I keep my hand on my sword and stay alert.
  dm: '**dan**: The party continues north for another mile, with dan keeping hand
    on sword and staying alert. Given dan''s neutral initiative, the party begins
    their movement as expected. As they advance into the 4-mile mark, the wolfmen,
    hidden in the dense forest flanking the Old Road, erupt from their concealed positions
    with guttural snarls. The Jagari, Witari, two Hunters, and an Apprentice charge
    the unsuspecting group.


    **Luath**: React to the sudden ambush and prepare defenses. Given Luath''s moderately
    positive initiative, he reacts swiftly to the sudden attack. His nervousness and
    the shock of the ambush cause him to instinctively reach for his Moonshade vial.
    His moderately negative skills luck means his attempt to quickly prepare a vial
    is clumsy, nearly causing him to drop it. However, his slightly positive defensive
    luck allows him to brace himself against a large oak tree as the first wolfman
    lunges, providing a moment of stability. He doesn''t consume the Moonshade yet,
    but he is preparing his defenses and his preferred stimulant.


    **Eiliad**: React to the ambush by drawing her bow and finding a firing position.
    Given Eiliad''s slightly positive initiative and skills luck, she reacts with
    practiced efficiency. She draws her shortbow and nocks an arrow, her keen eyes
    already assessing targets. Her slightly positive skills luck means she can quickly
    and silently draw her bow, finding a good firing position behind a large oak tree,
    ready to unleash a shot.


    **Firghorm**: React to the ambush by drawing his sword and shield and intercepting
    the closest threat. Given Firghorm''s slightly positive initiative, he acts swiftly.
    He draws his steel longsword and plain steel shield. His slightly negative defensive
    luck means he''s not quite as prepared for the initial shock of the attack as
    he''d like, making his defensive stance slightly less solid, but his innate vigilance
    still guides him. He moves to intercept the Jagari that is attacking him, planting
    his shield firmly to block the initial charge.


    **Draenen**: React to the ambush by drawing her knife and preparing her supplies.
    Given Draenen''s slightly positive initiative, she reacts quickly. She draws her
    knife and clutches her satchel. Her slightly negative skills luck means she fumbles
    slightly with her sling, making it harder to prepare a ranged shot immediately,
    but she manages to keep her wits about her, readying herself to use a poultice
    or antidote if needed.


    **dan**: React to the ambush by keeping hand on sword and staying alert. Given
    dan''s neutral initiative, he reacts as expected. He draws his sword and braces
    himself, scanning the attackers. His moderately negative defensive luck means
    he''s slightly less able to avoid the initial shock of the attack or find perfect
    cover, making his defensive posture less effective, but he''s still prepared to
    fight and stay alert.'

        Firghorm''s reactions and timing will be slightly faster than they would normally
        be.


        Firghorm''s slightly improved initiative luck is just enough to act before
        opponents Firghorm would find "moderately quick", but if the opponent is "quite"
        or "very" fast, they will still act first.

      - 'Skills luck:

        This round Draenen has slightly negative skills luck; if you''d expect Draenen
        to narrowly succeed at a skilled task, in this situation, Draenen would narrowly
        fail.


        Likewise, if a climbing hold would barely support Draenen''s weight, it gives
        way, or if Draenen would just manage to move silently, they make a small noise
        with skills luck slightly against Draenen.


        Draenen''s skilled actions will be slightly less effective than they would
        normally be.


        Draenen''s slightly reduced skills luck is just enough to fail at tasks Draenen
        would find mildly challenging, but if the skilled task is easy or of normal
        difficulty for Draenen, Draenen will still succeed, perhaps more narrowly.

        Draenen to act just after another character, in this situation, Draenen would
