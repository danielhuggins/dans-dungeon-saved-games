    - Turning that into a story


    You stand on the rocky shore of Lake Avertayn, the smooth stones shifting slightly
    under your feet. The sky above is overcast, casting a gray light over the calm
    waters that stretch before you. The lake''s surface is undisturbed save for gentle
    ripples near the shore, and while several fishing huts and weathered jetties dot
    the coastline, no boats are currently visible on the water.


    Above you, the village of Avertayn clings to its hillside perch. Smoke rises from
    several chimneys, and you can see villagers moving between the timber and thatch
    buildings. The paths leading up from the shore are partially overgrown, winding
    their way between the organically arranged dwellings. The great hall stands prominent
    among the smaller structures, its larger form dominating the village skyline.


    To the west, dense woods fill the valleys, creating a dark and foreboding presence.
    The forest transitions gradually from the shoreline, with scattered trees becoming
    progressively thicker. A deer is visible at the forest''s edge, cautiously drinking
    from the lake before darting back into the cover of the trees.


    Your companions are spread nearby: Firghorm stands watchful in his blue cloak,
    scanning the surroundings; Draenen kneels to examine plants along the shoreline;
    Eiliad''s eyes dart between various vantage points; and Luath nervously adjusts
    his alchemical supplies.


    Visible paths lead:

    - North: Up the overgrown path to the village

    - East: Along the rocky shoreline

    - West: Along the shore toward the woods

    - South: A jetty extends into the lake'
