  reasoning_summary: "**Analyzing potential actions**\n\nI think the Wolfmen might be getting ready but maybe not acting just\
    \ yet. There’s a group called the \"Moonwell Pack\" to consider. I should calculate their potential involvement alongside\
    \ our party members. Firghorm just finished his turn but can act again; the same goes for the others like Draenen, Eiliad,\
    \ and Luath. There’s some urgency since they need a guide, and Eiliad seems likely to take the lead in scouting ahead.\
    \ It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out!\n**Calculating probabilities and comparisons**\n\nI’m considering how\
    \ to assign weights to characters: Eiliad gets 0.4, Firghorm 0.25, Draenen 0.2, Luath 0.1, and the Wolfmen 0.05 for their\
    \ unseen prep. With these, I want to create pairwise comparisons that reflect the probabilities of each character against\
    \ one another.\n\nI’ll start with comparisons like Eiliad vs. Firghorm, normalizing their weights to find the ratio. Each\
    \ character needs to show up in at least three comparisons, so I’ll generate a set of ten comparisons to ensure fairness.\
    \ Let's get started on that!\n\n---\n\n**Considering possible consequences**\n\nI'm thinking about the scenario where\
    \ the party is about to start walking and may hear a distant howl, hinting at what's ahead. There could be wolfmen pack\
    \ ambushing nearby, and the party's first steps will have various potential consequences. For instance, Firghorm might\
    \ notice fresh tracks, which could be a danger sign, or he could stumble, causing noise. Other effects include the party\
    \ establishing a tight formation for defense, visibility changes due to mist, and even a hidden bird startling them. Let’s\
    \ explore those consequences further!\n**Identifying consequences and NPC actions**\n\nI’m outlining the consequences\
    \ of the party's movements, focusing on potential outcomes like spotting fresh tracks or Firghorm tripping on cobblestones,\
    \ which could create noise. Other events include the mist rolling in, reflecting sunlight off weapons, and a startled\
    \ deer. That gives me ten consequences already, which is great! \n\nNow, I’ll think about NPC actions: maybe wolfmen scouts\
    \ move closer, a distant wolf pack hunts, or a merchant caravan approaches. Let’s brainstorm some more options!"
