- user: I signal to Eiliad to scout ahead while we advance cautiously
  dm: 'You signal Eiliad. A sharp, precise gesture, a language of motion understood
    between you, the intent clear: reconnaissance. She melts into the dappled shadow
    of the ancient oaks, a whisper of movement against the moss-laden stone. Her steps
    are practiced, designed to leave no trace, to disturb no leaf unnecessarily. From
    the cover of the dense undergrowth, she finds her vantage. The wolfmen are there,
    positioned in their ambush, their presence yet unknown to them.


    Behind you, the rest of the party advances with measured caution. Firghorm’s presence
    is a solid anchor, his gaze sweeping the tree line, his hand never far from his
    sword hilt, tracking Eiliad’s progress as much as the path ahead. Draenen, ever
    observant of the natural world, scans the flora, her worn leather satchel a familiar
    weight against her hip, staying close to Firghorm’s steady presence. Luath, a
    knot of nervous energy, fidgets with a vial, muttering soft, unintelligible phrases
    that trail off into the humid air, his focus inward.


    The wolfmen, masters of their corrupted domain, remain precisely where they are,
    unseen, unheard, their coiled tension a silent promise of the violence to come.
    Moments later, Eiliad reappears from the treeline, her expression unchanged, her
    report delivered with the same economy of motion that marked her departure. The
    information she carries is stark: the number of threats, their positions, the
    trap laid for you.'

- user: I prepare my weapon and tell the party to form a defensive position
  dm: 'The air on the Old Road, heavy with the scent of damp earth and ancient oak,
    presses in around you. Eiliad’s report hangs in the charged silence like a drawn
    bowstring – wolfmen, waiting, a mile ahead. The knowledge of their presence, the
    coiled threat, tightens your gut. You signal to Eiliad, a sharp, precise gesture,
    a language of motion understood between you, the intent clear: reconnaissance.

    Moments later, Eiliad reappears from the treeline, her expression unchanged, her
    report delivered with the same economy of motion that marked her departure. The
    information she carries is stark: the number of threats, their positions, the
    trap laid for you.


    This is not a moment for hesitation. You grip the hilt of your sword, the familiar
    weight a small comfort. "Form up!" you bark, your voice cutting through the quiet
    dread. "Defensive perimeter! Now!"


    Immediately, the group reacts. Firghorm, ever the immovable bulwark, doesn''t
    need a second command. His steel longsword is drawn with a smooth, practiced rasp,
    the plain steel shield rising to meet the unseen threat. His grey eyes, tinged
    with blue, fix on the direction Eiliad indicated, his stance widening, a silent
    promise to absorb any blow. He reinforces his position, a solid wall of muscle
    and resolve. "Aye," he rumbles, his voice calm despite the imminent danger, a
    low anchor in the rising tide of tension. "Hold the line."


    Beside him, Draenen moves with purpose, her worn apron and satchel a familiar
    sight. She positions herself close to Firghorm, her hazel eyes scanning the surroundings
    for any immediate advantage, her hands already reaching for her own tools. She
    trusts Firghorm''s strength, and her own presence there is a silent declaration
    of her commitment to protect, to be indispensable.


    Luath, meanwhile, fumbles discreetly with a small vial from his bandolier. A tiny
    glint of silvery powder catches the dappled light. He brings it to his nose, a
    quick, furtive inhalation, his mutterings growing slightly more coherent, a desperate
    attempt to steady his frayed nerves. "Just... need a moment..." he whispers, his
    eyes momentarily losing their wildness, replaced by a flicker of focused, albeit
    drug-induced, clarity. He checks his satchel, ensuring his precious alchemical
    tools are within easy reach, a fragile defense against the encroaching horror.


    Eiliad, having delivered her vital intelligence, remains a study in stillness.
    Her sharp green eyes continue their ceaseless sweep of the surrounding woods,
    her body poised, ready to react. She trusts your tactical judgment, and her own
    role is now observation, waiting for the opportune moment to strike or evade.


    But the wolfmen have heard your command. They sense the shift, the party forming
    ranks, the brief moment of preparation. They see not a unified defense, but a
    group caught mid-motion, vulnerable. Their patience, honed by countless ambushes,
    snaps. The forest floor erupts.


    A guttural roar splits the air, not one, but many, a chorus of primal fury. From
    the dense undergrowth, figures of nightmare burst forth – hulking shapes of matted
    fur, twisted limbs, and eyes that burn with malevolent, corrupted light. They
    surge from the trees, their bronze-bound weapons glinting, their movements unnaturally
    swift. The ambush, timed to catch you unprepared, hits with brutal efficiency
    as you are still adjusting your formation.


    The world explodes into a cacophony of snarls, the clang of steel, and the sharp
    crack of Eiliad’s bow. Firghorm is already engaged, his shield absorbing the initial,
    vicious lunge of a mutated wolfman, his sword a blur of motion. Draenen, caught
    slightly out of position as she moved to support Firghorm, scrambles back, her
    hand instinctively going to her satchel, her eyes wide with the sudden, terrifying
    reality of the attack. Luath, jolted by the sudden violence, stumbles, his Moonshade-induced
    focus momentarily shattered by the sheer ferocity of the assault. Eiliad, ever
    the scout, has already loosed an arrow, a thin whistle that finds its mark in
    the shoulder of a charging beast, but more are coming. The ambush has sprung,
    and the fight for survival has begun in earnest.'
