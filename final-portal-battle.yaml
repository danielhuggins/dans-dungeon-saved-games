    You and your trusted companions make camp at the ancient waystone marking the entrance to the Tapestry of Reveries. The massive stone door stands before you, carved with intricate patterns that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them.

As you prepare your gear and share a meal, there's a sense of anticipation mixed with camaraderie. You've faced dangers together before, and your bonds have only grown stronger. The entrance awaits whenever you're ready to begin your delve into the legendary dungeon
- user: I examine the stone door carefully, looking for any clues about how to open it.
  dm: |-
    You place your hand on a deep carving of the imposing entrance. The stone beneath your touch shifts. The designs etched into the portal begin to flow, like molten rock. The large eye at the top brightens, its red glow intensifying. The faint murmurs you heard earlier now resolve into distinct voices, speaking directly to you with an ancient resonance, perhaps posing a riddle or a warning.

    Luath, detecting the arcane disturbance, cries out, "It's reacting! A sympathetic vibration!" He quickly pulls out a shimmering vial, eager to probe the portal further, driven by his need to understand and control such power.

    Draenen, feeling the oppressive energy surge, calls out, "Firghorm, pull back! It's changing! Everyone, be ready!" She readies her healing supplies.

    Eiliad draws her bow, her gaze sweeping the desolate surroundings for anything drawn by the increased energy. The entrance is now active.
- user: |-
    I hold my position but keep my hand on the carving, not wanting to break whatever connection has been established. 'Stay ready but don't attack,' I tell the others calmly. 'It's trying to communicate.' I focus on the ancient voices, trying to understand their words. 'What are you saying?' I ask the door clearly. To Luath I add, 'Can you sense what kind of magic this is? Is it a test, a ward, or something else?'
  dm: |-
    You press your hand against the stone barrier, seeking to decipher the ancient utterances. "What are you saying?" you ask the voices. Turning to Luath, you inquire, "Can you sense the nature of this magic? Is it a test, a ward, or something else entirely?" Before you can get a response, Luath, his eyes alight with discovery, uncorks a flask of his latest volatile creation. "This energy... it's unstable! I need to categorize it, maybe stabilize it! Stand back!" he exclaims, thrusting the flask towards a glowing rune on the portal. Draenen cries out, her voice sharp with alarm, "Luath, NO! What are you doing?!" and lunges to intercept him, but she's too far. Eiliad shouts, "Luath, you fool!" and notches an arrow, her gaze flicking between him and the portal, ready for anything. The deep, resonant tone of the voices abruptly shifts to agitated shrieks. The eye on the portal flashes a hostile crimson. Luath's flask reacts violently with the portal's power, unleashing a sudden, intense glare and a forceful surge that shoves everyone back. Luath stumbles, dropping his vial, which shatters harmlessly. Draenen is momentarily stunned by the blast, and Eiliad braces herself, her aim now uncertain. You're forced away from the stone, a sharp jolt stinging your hand. The portal itself recoils, its flowing carvings freezing, the voices falling silent, replaced by an ominous hum. You now face a hostile, activated entrance, thanks to Luath's premature action.
- user: |-
    I quickly assess the situation. 'Everyone back\! Form up\!' I command, pulling my shield forward. To Luath I say firmly but not harshly, 'It's alright, we'll handle this. Just stay behind me.' I study the portal's new state - is it opening, attacking, or sealing itself? To Draenen: 'Be ready with healing if this goes bad.' To Eiliad: 'Watch our flanks, this commotion might draw attention.'
  dm: |-
    The force of the portal's reaction shoves you hard. You hit the ground, the air around the entrance now thick with a palpable, malevolent energy. The low hum you heard earlier swells into a powerful thrum, and the intense crimson light flares, projecting something unseen. It strikes not your body, but your mind. A crushing wave of memory floods your thoughts, pulling you back to a moment of utter failure. You see the faces of your lost comrades, the crumbling defenses, the shield that failed. Your own strength falters; your grip on your sword loosens, your shield arm trembling. You glance around and see the others struck by this unseen force. Draenen gasps, her knees buckling as she sinks to the ground, lost in a vision of her apprentice’s ruin. Eiliad freezes mid-motion, her keen gaze unfocused, her bow lowering as if she's suddenly detached from everything. Luath is on his knees, head in his hands, muttering incoherently, overwhelmed by a replay of the explosion and its victims. The entrance is no longer just a barrier; it has become an active adversary, attacking your very thoughts.
- user: |-
    Fighting through the crushing weight of memory, I grip my sword hilt until my knuckles turn white, using the physical pain to anchor myself to the present. 'These are... shadows\!' I force out through gritted teeth. 'Not real... anymore\!' I slam the pommel of my sword against my shield, creating a loud CLANG that cuts through the oppressive atmosphere. 'Draenen\! Eiliad\! Luath\! Listen to my voice\! Focus on the sound\!' I strike the shield again, establishing a rhythm. 'We survived those moments\! We're HERE\! NOW\! Together\!'
  dm: |-
    The impact sends a fresh wave of past failures through your mind, a deluge that threatens to drown you. You dig the cold steel of your sword hilt into your palm, forcing a sharp sensation of pain to anchor you to the present. With a sharp impact, you strike your shield’s edge, the percussive sound a desperate attempt to cut through the mental chaos. "Draenen! Eiliad! Luath!" you roar, trying to pull them back. "Hear me! Focus on this sound!" But your efforts are futile. Draenen remains lost in her vision, unresponsive. Eiliad is utterly detached, her gaze vacant. Luath is buried in his own torment, your sounds just more noise in his internal nightmare. The portal’s low hum intensifies into a raw cacophony, and the crimson light flares, searing your vision. From its surface, dark limbs reach out towards all of you. You’re still trapped, and now the danger is physical as well as mental.
- user: |-
    Seeing the dark limbs emerging, I force myself to move despite the mental assault. I throw myself between the portal and my companions, raising my shield. 'You want someone to blame? Blame ME\!' I shout at the portal, trying to draw its attention. 'I'm the leader\! I brought them here\! Take your anger out on me, not them\!' I ready my sword to strike at any limb that gets too close to my friends, using my protective instincts to overcome the paralyzing memories.
  dm: |-
    The mental assault escalates, a torrent of past failures threatening to overwhelm me. I grip my sword hilt until my knuckles whiten, the sharp sting of steel biting into my palm a welcome anchor to this moment. I shout their names, trying to pierce the fog clouding their minds. "Draenen! Eiliad! Luath! Focus on my voice!" But my calls are lost. Draenen remains lost in her own private torment. Eiliad stands frozen, her eyes vacant. Luath is lost in his own internal chaos, my words just background noise.

    The portal's hum escalates into a deafening roar, its crimson light searing my vision. Dark, grasping extensions emerge from its surface, reaching for all of us. I'm still caught in this mental trap, and now physical danger is closing in. It wants a target. It sees me as the primary obstacle, the one who defies it. "If you want someone to blame," I yell, planting my shield firmly and drawing its gaze, "Blame ME! I'm the leader! I brought them here! Take your anger out on me, not them!"

    The portal's full attention snaps to me. The mental barrage intensifies, aiming to shatter my will, while the dark limbs lash out, seeking to crush or impale me. I brace myself, shield raised, sword ready. My friends are still lost in their own nightmares, and now I'm alone in this desperate fight against the dungeon's core.
- user: |-
    I plant my feet and meet the first dark limb with my shield, deflecting it to the side. As another reaches for me, I slash with my sword, trying to sever it. 'I've failed before,' I growl through the mental assault, 'but I won't fail them again\!' I keep myself between the portal and my companions, using controlled retreating steps to draw the attacks away from where they kneel. Each parry and strike is fueled by determination to protect rather than past regrets.
  dm: |-
    The portal's energy sears my mind, a wave of past regrets washing over me. I dig the rough metal of my sword's grip into my palm, the sharp pain a welcome anchor. "Draenen! Eiliad! Luath!" I bellow, trying to pierce the fog that holds them. "Hear me! Focus on this sound!" But my calls are lost. Draenen remains lost in her vision of her apprentice's ruin, Eiliad stands frozen, her eyes blank, and Luath is lost in his own internal turmoil. The portal's drone swells to a deafening pitch, its crimson light intensifying as shadowy appendages writhe forth, reaching for all of us. I plant my feet, shield braced, sword ready. I brace my shield against a larger limb, the impact sending a shock through my entire frame. I swing Soulreaver, cleaving through a shadow tendril, the rough grip of my sword tearing my palm further, drawing blood. Internally, I set my jaw against the onslaught, my duty to them the only thing keeping me upright. "I've failed before, but I won't fail them again!" I growl, my voice rough. The stone beneath my boots groans under the force of the impacts, and the air vibrates with raw power. Their stillness, lost in their own nightmares, weighs heavily on me, a constant reminder of what I must protect.
- user: |-
    I continue fighting the shadow limbs, keeping them away from my companions. Between strikes, I shout: 'Remember why we're here\! Remember what we've overcome together\!' I focus on defense, using my shield to create a protective barrier around the group.
  dm: |-
    Your stance holds. You deflect the grasping shadows with your shield, your sword meeting them with sharp, ringing blows. The bite of the sword's grip in your hand is a sharp, grounding sensation. Your voice, rough and strained, finds a rhythm. "Together!" you roar, "We are together!" The words, repeated like a chant, begin to cut through the fog in your mind. Luath stirs beside you. His disjointed whispers change, echoing your words: "...together... together..." He pushes himself up onto his knees, his eyes still unfocused, but the utter blankness is gone. Draenen and Eiliad remain locked in their own private torment, unresponsive to your efforts. The portal senses your defiance, and Luath's slight movement. The hum deepens, and more dark limbs surge towards you, their attacks growing fiercer. For a moment, the mental weight pressing on Draenen and Eiliad seems to ease, as if the portal's focus has shifted. You've bought a fragile moment, and Luath shows a spark of returning awareness. But the danger is far from over; the portal is now concentrating its full force on you.
- user: |-
    I keep defending against the shadow limbs while calling to Luath: 'Luath\! Can you reach Draenen? Touch her, shake her, anything to break her trance\!'
  dm: |-
    Your mind strains against the portal's relentless pressure, but Luath's stirring gives you a flicker of hope. He begins to crawl towards Draenen, his hand outstretched. Just as you see his attempt, the portal reacts violently to this disruption. The hum you felt before erupts into a deafening roar, and the crimson light flares, not just blinding but lashing out with raw, uncontrolled energy. A crushing wave of pure void washes over you, and the shadow limbs thrash wildly, striking out indiscriminately. You stagger, your stance breaking, forced to your knees as the force slams into you. Luath, caught in the surge, is thrown back, his unsteady recovery shattered. Draenen and Eiliad, still lost in their own private horrors, are jolted by the blast, their trances deepening or shifting into something new. The very ground trembles, and the air fills with a deafening cacophony as the entrance explodes into chaos.
- user: |-
    On my knees from the blast, I realize brute force won't work. I lower my sword and shield, placing them on the ground. 'We're not your enemies,' I speak directly to the portal, forcing calm into my voice despite the chaos. 'We seek the Tapestry of Reveries. We've come with respect, not conquest. These visions you show us - we've learned from our failures. That's why we're stronger now.' I remain kneeling, non-threatening, hoping reason might succeed where force failed.
  dm: |-
    You remain on your knees, shield braced, sword ready. The portal's deep vibration shifts. You see Luath, still unsteady, begin to crawl toward Draenen. As he moves, a portion of the portal's power—two of those grasping extensions—breaks free from its main assault and slams into Luath. He's struck, thrown back, and collapses, motionless. The portal's full attention snaps back to you. The immense pressure you were enduring grows, your defenses weakening under the focused onslaught. Draenen and Eiliad remain lost, their minds elsewhere, unaffected by this latest surge but still entirely out of the fight. Luath is down, and the full force of the portal's fury is now solely on you.
- user: I crawl to Luath to check if he's alive.
  dm: |-
    My own past failures press down, a suffocating fog. I see you, a lone bulwark, holding back the encroaching darkness. Then, a flicker of movement: Luath, still unsteady, begins to drag himself towards Draenen. The portal senses this. Its fury divides. A sharp mental blow strikes Eiliad, and her vacant stare snaps into focus. But as her awareness returns, two of the grasping shadows break from their assault on you. They slam into Luath, tossing him aside like a rag doll. The portal's full attention, and its overwhelming force, snaps back to you. My own body feels like lead, my mind still struggling against the visions, but I strain to rise. I see Eiliad blinking, trying to orient herself, but she's clearly disoriented. The threat remains, now fractured by Eiliad's return and Luath's renewed incapacitation.
- user: |-
    'Eiliad\!' I shout while deflecting another shadow limb. 'I need you\! Luath is down\!' I point to where he fell. 'Can you get to him? Pull him back from the portal\!' I keep myself between the portal and my companions, buying time. 'And shoot these damned shadows if you can\!'
  dm: |-
    The impact has driven me to my knees again. The raw force of the portal’s blast is immense, a physical blow that rattles my bones and intensifies the mental torment. My sight blurs, but I see Eiliad nearby. Her eyes, moments ago blank, now dart around, as if clearing away a haze. She’s returning to herself, though she looks confused.

    Beside her, Luath lies still, thrown aside. He’s not moving. The portal’s focus returns to me. The dark limbs continue their relentless assault.

    I can’t hold this alone. I need Eiliad to move.

    "Eiliad!" I grit out, my voice rough. "Luath's down! Get him clear! Pull him back!" I shift my shield slightly, trying to keep the worst of the limbs focused on me. "And shoot those things! Help me!"
- user: |-
    I watch for Eiliad's response while maintaining my defensive position. If she moves to help Luath, I'll shift my stance to cover them both. 'Draenen\!' I call out, hoping to reach her too. 'Your herbs\! Your healing\! We need you\!' I keep fighting, using my shield and sword to create a defensive zone.
  dm: |-
    Your voice tears from your throat, raw from the assault. You see Eiliad’s eyes clear, a spark of awareness returning to her gaze. Luath lies still beside you, a heap of discarded gear and limbs. The portal’s relentless pressure on you shifts; two of its shadowy extensions veer away, drawn by Eiliad’s stirring. This is your chance. You watch as Eiliad makes her choice. Instead of moving for Luath, she draws her bow, aiming at the largest shadow limb currently lashing at you. The arrow flies true, causing the limb to flicker and momentarily break apart. But the portal senses this defiance. Its full attention, previously divided, snaps onto Eiliad. The crushing pressure on you ceases, replaced by a searing wave of pure malice directed solely at her. Luath and Draenen remain unmoving. You’ve gained a moment’s reprieve, but Eiliad is now the sole focus of the dungeon’s fury.
- user: |-
    Seeing the portal shift focus to Eiliad, I surge forward with renewed energy. 'No\! Not her\!' I charge at the portal itself, slamming my shield into its surface with all my strength. 'Face me, you coward\! I'm the one who challenged you\!' I want to force it to split its attention between us.
  dm: |-
    The oppressive force that had held me vanishes. I see Eiliad’s eyes clear as she draws her bow, sending an arrow towards the dark appendage that had been striking me. It recoils, its form wavering. The portal’s entire attention locks onto her. The mental fog that had clouded my thoughts begins to lift, leaving me gasping for air. Luath is still motionless on the ground, and Draenen remains lost in her own world. Eiliad is now the one facing the full brunt of the dungeon’s rage. I have a brief window, but it’s not enough. I can’t let her face this alone. With a surge of resolve, I push myself up. "Draenen! Luath!" I call out, my voice strained, trying to reach them, but they don't stir. Eiliad is now the one bearing the brunt of the portal's fury. I have to draw its focus back. I charge, shield braced, sword ready. "Here!" I roar, slamming my shield into the portal's surface. "Take your anger out on me!"
- user: |-
    I press my attack on the portal, striking it repeatedly with my sword while shouting. 'Eiliad, keep shooting\! We fight together\!' I glance at Draenen and try one more approach: 'Draenen\! Your patient needs you\! Luath is hurt\!' I hope appealing to her healer's instincts might break through where other attempts failed.
  dm: |-
    As your shield slams into the portal, its furious gaze snaps back to you. The mental onslaught you endured moments ago returns, now amplified. Your own words, "I won't fail them again," echo back, twisted by the portal's power into a suffocating burden of past regrets. The memory of your last stand, of those you couldn't save, crashes down, threatening to break your resolve. The dark extensions continue their unceasing attack, forcing you to parry and block, each impact jarring your battered body. You see Eiliad nearby, her awareness returning, but Luath lies still beside you, a heap of discarded gear, motionless. The portal, sensing this shift, momentarily divides its wrath. Two grasping tendrils break from their assault on you and strike Luath, sending him sprawling. The full force of the portal's rage then snaps back to you, the weight of its attention almost unbearable. Eiliad is momentarily free, but the portal's focus is now divided between you and her, and Luath is down. You feel your own strength waning under this dual pressure.
- user: |-
    Through gritted teeth, I make a desperate decision. 'The portal feeds on our pain and regret\!' I shout to Eiliad. 'We need to starve it\!' I force myself to think not of failures but victories - saving a child from bandits, the time Draenen's quick thinking saved us from poison, Eiliad's perfect shot that saved my life, Luath's explosion that accidentally revealed a hidden treasure. 'Remember our triumphs\!' I yell, filling my mind with moments of joy and success.
  dm: |-
    You remain on your knees, the portal’s full attention locked onto you. The mental pressure is immense, a weight trying to drag you back into the mire of past failures. You grit your teeth, forcing your mind away from the onslaught. You focus on the faces of those you *did* save, the moments of triumph. You shout words of defiance, not of memory, grounding yourself in the present.

    Beside you, Luath lies still, a heap of discarded gear. Draenen remains unresponsive, lost in her own world. You see Eiliad nearby, her eyes clearing, a spark of awareness returning. She takes in the scene: you fighting, Luath down, Draenen out. Directly confronting the portal seems too dangerous for her. Instead, she shifts her position, moving behind a cluster of jagged rocks. From this new vantage, she begins to observe the portal’s attack patterns, noting the rhythm of the shadow limbs and the intensity of the psychic waves.

    The portal, sensing you as the primary threat, intensifies its assault. It registers Eiliad’s movement but considers her a secondary concern for now. You are alone against its full power.
- user: |-
    Seeing Eiliad take cover, I understand her strategy. I need to keep the portal focused on me. I stand tall despite the mental assault, raising my shield high. 'Is that all you have?' I taunt the portal. 'Shadows and old memories? I've faced worse\!' I deliberately make myself a target, moving in a pattern that might help Eiliad spot a weakness. 'Every scar makes us stronger\!'
  dm: |-
    You plant your feet, your shield absorbing another jarring impact. The weight of past defeats presses down, but you push it back, focusing instead on the faces of those you saved, the moments of triumph. You see Eiliad shift behind the jagged rocks. Her eyes, now clearer, scan the entrance. She's tracking its tells, the subtle flickers in the air, the variations in its deep hum. It seems she's filing away these details, perhaps making mental notes, deciding direct engagement is too risky for now. The entrance's rage, which had been split, now snaps back to you with renewed intensity. It senses your defiance, your struggle, and considers Eiliad a lesser concern for the moment. The psychic burden you carry grows heavier. Luath remains a still heap of gear. Draenen is lost in her own world. You are the sole focus of the entrance's overwhelming power.
- user: |-
    I continue my defiant stance but shift tactics. Instead of pure resistance, I try to understand the portal. 'You're a guardian, aren't you?' I speak between defending against shadow limbs. 'Testing those who would enter. But this test... it's broken, corrupted. We're not here to despoil - we're here to understand\!' I maintain my defense while trying to find reason within the rage.
  dm: |-
    You plant your feet, shield raised against the barrage. "You are a guardian, not a tormentor!" you call out, your voice strained. "Your purpose is twisted! We seek understanding, not destruction!" The portal, however, disregards your words. It interprets your plea as a sign of fraying resolve. The psychic pressure surges, conjuring specters of your past defeats and forcing visions of your shortcomings upon you. Eiliad, seeing your desperate tactic yield no results, retreats further behind a larger outcrop of rock. Her sharp eyes continue to observe the entrance's patterns, prioritizing her own safety and gathering intelligence. Luath remains a still form on the ground, and Draenen is lost in her own world. The portal's undivided attention, previously split, now centers entirely on you. You are alone in this struggle.
- user: |-
    Realizing words won't work, I change tactics completely. I stop fighting the mental assault and instead embrace it. 'Yes, I failed them,' I admit, letting the memories flow. 'But their sacrifice taught me. Made me who I am.' I lower my shield slightly, not in surrender but in acceptance. 'If you must judge me, judge all of me - failures AND triumphs.' I stand ready but no longer purely defensive.
  dm: |-
    You plant your feet, shield braced. The portal's mental pressure surges, a flood of your past mistakes crashing over you. You force yourself to acknowledge them, not fight them. "Yes, I failed," you declare, your voice rough. "But those failures forged me." You lower your shield slightly, a gesture of acceptance rather than surrender. The portal seizes on this, its psychic onslaught growing fiercer. Memories of your last stand, of those you couldn't save, resurface with agonizing clarity. The dark limbs lash out with increased ferocity, each impact jarring your worn frame. Eiliad, from her cover behind the jagged rocks, studies the entrance’s movements. She notes how, at the height of your mental torment, the dark extensions recoil for a moment, and the portal's red glow wavers. She marks this anomaly, a potential weakness. Luath remains a still form on the ground. Draenen is lost in her own private torment. You are worn down, but your defiance holds.
- user: |-
    I hold my ground and continue accepting the memories while watching for the portal's reaction.
  dm: |-
    Your last stand is faltering. The relentless barrage of remembered failures, coupled with the impacts from the shadowy extensions, has taken its toll. The portal senses this fraying of your will. It capitalizes on the opening with a crushing wave of raw power, striking both mind and body. Your spirit breaks. You are consumed by the specters of your past mistakes, your resolve shattered. You collapse, your sword clattering from your numb grasp. The portal's attention shifts from you. Its fury now turns towards the others. It lashes out indiscriminately at Eiliad, Luath, and Draenen, or perhaps it begins to seal itself shut. Eiliad, seeing you fall from her cover, her eyes having noted a brief flicker in the portal's glow during your final moments of torment, faces an urgent decision: attempt a risky rescue, try to escape with the incapacitated Luath and Draenen, or prepare for the next phase of the entrance's assault.
- user: |-
    Though my body has failed, my mind fights on. From where I've fallen, I use the last of my strength to shout to Eiliad: 'The flicker\! When it feeds on pain - it weakens\! Use that\!' I try to crawl toward my sword, refusing to give up completely.
  dm: |-
    My body lies spent, but my mind races. The crushing weight of the portal’s power has lifted from me, its attention now scattered among the others. I see Eiliad, regaining her senses behind the jagged rocks, her gaze sharp and assessing. Luath remains a still heap. Draenen is lost to her own world. I remember Eiliad’s earlier words, her observation of that brief flicker. *That’s it.* Pushing through the ache, I begin to drag myself across the ground towards my sword. A few wisps of shadow lash out, easily deflected by my worn shield. "Eiliad!" I rasp, my voice raw. "The flicker! When it’s overwhelmed by pain, it weakens! Watch for it!" My fingers finally close around the familiar hilt of my sword. As I grasp it, the full force of the portal's attention returns, locking onto me.
- user: |-
    Gripping my sword, I use it to push myself to one knee. 'Come on then\!' I growl at the portal. 'You want pain? I'll give you pain\!' I deliberately flood my mind with every agonizing memory - not to suffer, but to overload the portal. 'Every loss, every failure, every regret - TAKE IT ALL\!' I watch for that flicker Eiliad mentioned.
  dm: |-
    Your fingers close around the familiar, worn grip of your sword. The entrance's full power bears down on you again, its entire focus returning to you. The assault on your thoughts intensifies, a flood of old shame and loss slamming into you. Your strength gives out. Your knees buckle, your body betraying you. You fall, your sword skittering away across the stone. The intense pressure on you lifts, scattering outwards. The entrance's rage, no longer centered on you, now lashes out indiscriminately towards Eiliad, Luath, and Draenen. You see Eiliad, from her cover, her sharp eyes having caught that brief waver you both noticed earlier. "Eiliad!" you rasp, your voice raw. "The flicker! It weakens when it's overwhelmed by pain! Watch for it!"
- user: |-
    From where I've fallen, I watch Eiliad, hoping she understood. I try to keep the portal's attention by continuing to feed it memories, acting as bait while she prepares whatever plan she's forming.
  dm: |-
    My body has failed me. The immense pressure that held me captive has dispersed, its full attention now splintering. I see Eiliad, her eyes clearing, her sharp gaze assessing from behind the jagged rocks. Luath remains a still heap beside me. Draenen, however, is still lost in her own private torment. Then, a jolt. Her head snaps up, her eyes wide and suddenly clear. She sees me on the ground, then Luath. Her healer's instinct, that deep-seated need to mend, surges through her. Her hands, usually so steady, dart out. She snatches at my sword lying nearby, her intent clear – to defend me. The portal, sensing this new activity, reacts. Its focus, which had been solely on me, now divides. Two of its dark limbs lash out towards Eiliad, while the main force seems to falter for a moment, its red glow dimming slightly.
- user: |-
    'Draenen\!' I gasp from the ground. 'Don't fight it directly\! It feeds on pain and conflict\!' I point weakly toward the flickering glow. 'When we all suffered at once, it flickered - weakened. That's the key\!' I try to push myself up to help her.
  dm: |-
    Draenen moves with surprising speed, her hands darting out to grasp your sword. The immense pressure on your mind lessens as the portal’s full attention divides. You see Eiliad, observing from her rocky cover, her sharp eyes noting the portal’s momentary waver. Sensing an opening, she draws her bow. An arrow streaks from her cover, striking a cluster of glowing runes on the entrance. The portal reacts instantly, its rage erupting as its focus snaps to Eiliad. The crushing weight on you vanishes, allowing you to push yourself to your feet. Draenen stirs beside you, her eyes fluttering, but she remains lost in her vision. Luath lies still, a heap of discarded gear.
- user: |-
    I push myself up, using my sword as support. 'Everyone, listen\!' I call out with renewed strength. 'The portal has a weakness - when it absorbs too much suffering at once, it flickers and weakens. We need to coordinate\!' I look between Draenen and Eiliad. 'On my signal, we all need to act together.'
  dm: |-
    The oppressive force that held me vanishes as the entrance's full fury snaps to Eiliad. I see her, sharp-eyed and observing from her cover. Luath remains a still heap of discarded gear beside me. Draenen stirs, her eyes fluttering, but she’s still caught in her own ordeal. Then, her healer’s duty pulls her back. She sees Luath, her hands darting out to grasp my sword, her intent clear: to defend him. The entrance’s rage flares, its attention now locked onto Eiliad.

    My earlier thought is confirmed: it falters when overloaded. Eiliad’s arrow was a good distraction, but Draenen’s action is instinctual, not part of a plan. We need to act as one. Using my sword to steady myself, I rise. "Draenen!" I call out, my voice rough. "Luath needs help, but we need to act together first!" I glance towards Eiliad. "Eiliad! I saw it! It falters when it's overloaded! On my mark... we strike!" I brace myself, ready to give the command.

    'NOW\!' I shout, surging forward with my sword raised. I charge directly at the portal, pouring all my pain and determination into the assault. 'Hit it with everything\! Our pain, our resolve, our defiance\!' I strike at the glowing runes with my blade while flooding my mind with both agony and triumph.

    You charge, shield forward, sword ready. You slam into the entrance's surface. The raw power of the portal erupts, a tidal wave of force that crashes over you. Your reserves give out. You collapse, your sword skittering away. The portal’s entire fury locks onto you, its singular, terrifying aim now fixed on your downed form. From her cover, Eiliad watches. She sees you fall, sees the entrance’s undivided, devastating attention zero in on you. Her instincts scream survival. She moves swiftly, securing the unmoving Luath. A moment’s assessment, a stark choice, and she turns, pulling him away. You are left to the entrance’s wrath. Draenen remains lost in her own world.

    As the portal's fury bears down on me alone, I refuse to give in to despair. 'Run\!' I shout to Eiliad, approving her choice. 'Get him safe\! Find another way\!' Even as the crushing force overwhelms me, I smile grimly. They'll survive. That's what matters.

    Your strength fails. You fall, your sword sliding away. The overwhelming force on you vanishes. The entrance's full might turns, its entire attention now fixed on your collapsed form. You see Eiliad, her observing eyes assessing from her cover. Luath lies still beside you. Draenen remains unresponsive. You manage a raw rasp, "Go! Get him safe! Find another way!"

    Eiliad, ever resourceful, moves swiftly. She secures the still Luath and pulls him away from the immediate threat. She casts a brief glance back, a nod of understanding, but her own safety comes first. She seeks an exit, moving away from the entrance. The entrance's attention shifts, but you are its main target. Your path is cut off. Your group is now divided.

    Alone now with the portal's full attention, I make one last desperate gambit. I place my hand on the ground where my blood has spilled. 'You want to judge worthiness through pain?' I speak directly to it. 'Then judge this - I choose to bear it all so they don't have to. That is my answer to your test.'
  dm: |-
    My last words leave me, a rough rasp: "Go! Get him safe! Find another way!" My limbs refuse to obey, my body a dead weight on the cold stone. The overwhelming force that had pinned me has withdrawn, its terrible focus now fixed elsewhere. I see Eiliad, her sharp gaze assessing from her cover. Luath lies still beside me, a silent, unmoving form. Draenen remains lost, a statue in her own world. Eiliad, ever resourceful, moves with purpose. She secures the still Luath, pulling him away from the immediate danger. She casts a brief glance back, a nod of understanding, but her own safety comes first. She seeks an exit, moving away from the entrance. The entrance's attention has shifted, but I am its main target. My path is cut off. My group is now divided.
- user: I lie still and wait, conserving what little strength remains.
  dm: |-
    My body aches. I remain still, conserving my remaining strength. I see our leader fall, their weapon skittering away across the stone. The entrance's full attention, previously fixed on them, now shifts to me. Eiliad, ever watchful, has retrieved the motionless Luath and is moving away from the immediate danger. Draenen remains lost in her own private ordeal. I will wait. I will conserve my energy. I will watch.
