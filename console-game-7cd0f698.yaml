    - Turning that into a story

    You draw your sword and move cautiously forward along the Old Road, the ancient cobblestones worn smooth beneath your feet. The massive oaks tower overhead, their branches creating a natural cathedral ceiling that filters the light into shifting patterns on the ground.

    Eiliad naturally takes the lead, but rather than ranging ahead, she stays close to the group. Firghorm positions himself near Luath, who clutches his bandolier of alchemical vials with nervous energy. Draenen moves between the center of the road and its edges, her expert eyes scanning the vegetation.

    The party clusters together in a defensive formation, maintaining awareness in all directions. Eiliad's sharp eyes catch signs of normal forest life - deer tracks crossing the road, disturbed leaves where a rabbit passed, the distant chattering of squirrels in the canopy above.

    Near the road's edge, Draenen identifies several common medicinal herbs growing in the dappled shade of the ancient oaks. Her practiced hands gesture toward patches of yarrow and feverfew nestled between the moss-covered stones.

    The group maintains a careful but steady pace, navigating around protruding roots and broken sections of cobblestone. The ancient trees continue their silent watch as you advance deeper into Welwaen Forest.

    Exits: The Old Road continues north toward the Crossroads and south in the direction you came from. Small game trails occasionally branch off into the dense forest on either side.

    **Ragnar**:
    - Turning that into a story

    You draw your sword and attempt to move defensively to the right, but without a shield to balance your movement, you stumble slightly on the uneven cobblestones. The ancient road's surface, broken by centuries of tree roots, makes quick lateral movement treacherous.

    Firghorm's deep voice carries quiet authority: "Steady now. The road demands our attention."

    The group pauses briefly, the moment hanging in the dappled sunlight filtering through the oak canopy. Eiliad maintains her vigilant watch from the front, while Draenen's hands hover over a patch of yarrow growing between the stones. Luath clutches his bandolier of vials closer, eyes darting between the shadows cast by the massive trees.

    After this brief pause, the party resumes their careful progress northward along the Old Road.

    I sheathe my sword and apologize to the group for my stumble. 'My apologies, friends. The road caught me off guard.' I continue walking with them, keeping alert for any signs of danger.

    **Ragnar**:
    - Turning that into a story

    You sheathe your sword smoothly, the blade sliding home into its scabbard with a familiar sound that echoes briefly under the ancient oak canopy. The worn cobblestones beneath your feet continue their subtle challenge to sure footing as you maintain pace with the group.

    "My apologies, friends. The road caught me off guard," you say, your voice carrying clearly in the forest's relative quiet.

    Firghorm acknowledges with a deep grunt, his gray eyes never ceasing their vigilant scan of the surroundings. His weathered blue cloak shifts slightly as he maintains his protective position near Luath.

    "Happens to everyone," Luath offers quickly, his fingers fidgeting with the straps of his bandolier. "These stones have tripped greater warriors, I'd wager." His nervous energy seems momentarily channeled into the supportive comment before his attention returns to scanning the shadows between the trees.

    Ahead, Eiliad continues her careful scouting, moving with practiced grace over the uneven ground. Draenen's attention remains split between the road's edge and potentially useful herbs, her experienced eyes cataloging resources even as the group maintains their cautious advance.

    The ancient oaks continue their silent watch as your party moves northward, their massive branches filtering the sunlight into shifting patterns on the worn stones of the Old Road. The air carries the mixed scents of moss, old stone, and the forest's perpetual decay.

    Based on a careful analysis of Ragnar's attempt to examine the road ahead, considering the presence of hidden Wolfmen, environmental factors like the ancient forest and worn cobblestones, and the varying levels of perceptiveness possible, I've calculated the following consequences and their relative probabilities:

        description: |-
          The party halts and listens. Only the ordinary susurrus of Welwaen Forest reaches their ears—creaking boughs, distant birds, the sigh of summer wind through moss-laden oaks. No hint of threat is discerned, but everyone’s nerves tighten; future perception tests made within the next few minutes gain a slight edge as the group remains tense.
      - id: SubtleClueHeard
        description: |-
          Amid the natural chorus, a faint crack of bark or a brief shuffle of heavy bodies drifts across the road. The source cannot be pinned down, yet the sound is wrong for deer or squirrels. Suspicion rises; weapons are loosened, conversation dies, and travel speed is cut in half while the party debates whether to scout or prepare an ambush of their own.
      - id: UnintentionalNoiseFumble
        description: |-
          While freezing in place, one companion—perhaps Luath adjusting his bandolier or Firghorm shifting weight—snaps a dry twig. The sharp report carries through the undergrowth. Hidden Wolfmen (and other forest denizens) gain warning that the travellers are wary; the pack may reposition or advance its timetable, reducing the party’s chance to seize initiative when hostilities begin.
      - id: AmbushSignsDetected
        description: |-
          Low growls, controlled breathing, and the whisper of padded feet against leaf-litter filter through the hush. Ragnar and at least one companion recognise the pattern as coordinated predators. Though exact numbers and locations remain hazy, the group now knows an ambush lies ahead and can ready actions, set traps, or attempt to circumvent the danger.
